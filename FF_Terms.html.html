The panel of arbitrators may include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.

<P>The Jaguar Investment Group is a software provider, we do not offer investment advice or execute trades. The software provided is a tool where the settings are input by the end user to design their own trading strategy. As with any trading, you should not engage in it unless you understand the nature of the transaction you are entering, and the true extent of your exposure to the risk of loss. These products may not be suitable for all investors, therefore if you do not fully understand the risks involved, please seek independent advice. By purchasing this software, you acknowledge that we are not providing any financial advice whatsoever. We will not take any responsibility for any loses.
<P>CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. The vast majority of retail client accounts lose money when trading in CFDs. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. Do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose. There is considerable exposure to risk in any foreign exchange transaction. Any transaction involving currencies involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a currency. Investments in foreign exchange speculation may also be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the relevant market values fluctuate. The leveraged nature of Forex trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as for you. Not only may investors get back less than they invested, but in the case of higher risk strategies, investors may lose the entirety of their investment. It is for this reason that when speculating in such markets it is advisable to use only risk capital. Trade the Forex Market at your own risk. The Jaguar Investment Group will not take any responsibility for any loses. This software is neither a solicitation nor an offer to Buy/Sell stocks, forex, futures, options or any other trading instrument.
<P>Results are based on historical data. There is no guarantee of future performance. You should understand the risks involved with trading.
