U.S. Government Required Disclaimer - Commodity Futures Trading Commission Futures and Options trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. You must be aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in order to invest in the futures and options markets. Don't trade with money you can't afford to lose. This is neither a solicitation nor an offer to Buy/Sell futures or options. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those discussed on this web site. The past performance of any trading system or methodology is not necessarily indicative of future results.
<P>
CFTC RULE 4.41 - HYPOTHETICAL OR SIMULATED PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. UNLIKE AN ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RECORD, SIMULATED RESULTS DO NOT REPRESENT ACTUAL TRADING. ALSO, SINCE THE TRADES HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, THE RESULTS MAY HAVE UNDER-OR-OVER COMPENSATED FOR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF CERTAIN MARKET FACTORS, SUCH AS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. SIMULATED TRADING PROGRAMS IN GENERAL ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFIT OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN.
<P>
No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. Hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. The past performance of any trading system or methodology is not necessarily indicative of future results.  
<P>All information on the Forex Fusion Pro website is for educational purposes only and is not intended to provide financial advice. Any statements about profits or income, expressed or implied, does not represent a guarantee. Your actual trading may result in losses as no trading system is guaranteed. You accept full responsibilities for your actions, trades, profit or loss, and agree to hold the Jaguar Investment Group and any authorized distributors of this information harmless in any and all ways. 
<P>The Jaguar Investment Group is a software provider, we do not offer investment advice or execute trades. The software provided is a tool where the settings are input by the end user to design their own trading strategy. As with any trading, you should not engage in it unless you understand the nature of the transaction you are entering, and the true extent of your exposure to the risk of loss. These products may not be suitable for all investors, therefore if you do not fully understand the risks involved, please seek independent advice. By purchasing this software, you acknowledge that we are not providing any financial advice whatsoever. We will not take any responsibility for any loses.
<P>CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. The vast majority of retail client accounts lose money when trading in CFDs. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. Do not invest with money you cannot afford to lose. There is considerable exposure to risk in any foreign exchange transaction. Any transaction involving currencies involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a currency. Investments in foreign exchange speculation may also be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the relevant market values fluctuate. The leveraged nature of Forex trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as for you. Not only may investors get back less than they invested, but in the case of higher risk strategies, investors may lose the entirety of their investment. It is for this reason that when speculating in such markets it is advisable to use only risk capital. Trade the Forex Market at your own risk. Forex Fusion Pro or the Jaguary Investment Group will not take any responsibility for any loses. This software is neither a solicitation nor an offer to Buy/Sell stocks, forex, futures, options or any other trading instrument.
<P>Results are based on historical data. There is no guarantee of future performance. You should understand the risks involved with trading. Different trading brokers can produce different results due to factors such as spreads, slippage, liquidity, commissions and market conditions. Your capital is at risk. Beginner traders should research, read forex reviews and learn about trading before using any forex software.
<P>Your purchase of Forex Fusion Pro serves as your acknowledgement and representation that you have read and understand these TERMS OF USE and that you agree to be bound by such TERMS OF USE ("Agreement"). You accept that the agreement can be changed at any time and that you must comply with any changes made to the agreement.
